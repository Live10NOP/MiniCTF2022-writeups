# Password Cracking

Writeup by Arek Ouzounian

Congrats to everyone that participated in the USC CTF Team's first CTF! I'll use this folder to put my solutions on the password cracking section of the CTF. 

Each of the files in this folder will be a markdown file that includes the relevant steps and code that I used to solve each problem. 

Please note that there are many different ways to solve a given problem; I'll try to list possible alternatives, but my solutions are by no means the definitive ways to solve each of these problems! They're simply what worked for me. 

As a sidenote, the organization of each writeup will be as follows:
1) The name of the challenge
2) A screenshot of the challenge
3) My explanation/reasoning and breakdown of the challenge
4) Relevant screenshots and hyperlinks 
5) The Answer to the challenge

Happy Hacking!
